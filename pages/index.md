**[Genki](https://blog.genki.site/)** uses [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) open source technology, the easiest way to get a production instance deployed. It takes about 2 minutes to launch a new site with worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & more.

# Quickstart install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
ghost install local
```

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
ghost install
```
