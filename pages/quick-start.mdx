# Quickstart install

## Install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use the **CLI tool**

```js filename="install ghost-cli"
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```js filename="install ghost local"
ghost install local
```

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```js filename="install ghost"
ghost install
```

Check out **[Ghost official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/)** for more information about [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) & properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/update/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/) or work with [API](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/).
