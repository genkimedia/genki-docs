## Ghost Introduction

**[Ghost](https://ghost.org?ref=docs-genki)** is an open source, professional publishing platform built on a modern Node.js technology stack — designed for teams who need power, flexibility and performance.

Hitting the right balance of needs has led Ghost to be used in production by organisations including Apple, Sky News, DuckDuckGo, Mozilla, OpenAI, Square, CloudFlare, Tinder, the Bitcoin Foundation and [many more](https://ghost.org/explore/).

## Features

Ghost comes with powerful features built directly into the core software which can be customised and configured based on the needs of each individual site.

### Developer API

At its core Ghost is a self-consuming, `RESTful` `JSON` API with decoupled admin client and front-end. We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible, but at the end of the day it’s Just `JSON` ™️, so if you want to use Ghost completely headless and write your own frontend or backend… you can!

### customised editor

Ghost has the rich editor which every writer wants, but under the hood it delivers far more power than you would expect. All content is stored in a standardised `JSON-based` document storage format called MobileDoc, which includes support for extensible rich media objects called Cards.

### customised site structures

Routing in Ghost is completely configurable based on your needs. Out of the box Ghost comes with a standard reverse chronological feed of posts with clean permalinks and basic pages, but that’s easy to change.

### Roles & permissions

Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.

- Contributors: Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.
- Authors: Can create and publish new posts and tags.
- Editors: Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.
- Administrators: Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.
- Owner: An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.

### Custom themes

Ghost ships with a simple `Handlebars.js` front-end theme layer which is very straightforward to work with and surprisingly powerful. Many people stick with the default theme ([live demo](https://demo.ghost.io/) / [source code](https://github.com/tryghost/casper)), which provides a clean magazine design - but this can be modified or entirely replaced.

### integrations
Because Ghost is completely open source, built as a `JSON` API, has webhooks, and gives you full control over the front-end: It essentially integrates with absolutely everything.
